# Consistent Font Sizes in Keynote Figures

This repository contains resources and instructions for making figures with consistent font sizes in Keynote.

It includes a template Keynote file along with Python code.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have Keynote installed on your computer. If you do not have Keynote, you can download it from the App Store.

Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/reecehuff/FigureMakingGuide.git
```

and follow along in the [figure.making.guide.key](figure.making.guide.key) file.

This repository also includes a Python script for cropping your figures from the Keynote file once you're finished. 

## Additional Tips and Tricks

- You can use the Format Painter tool to quickly copy the font size and style from one text box to another. Simply select the text box with the formatting you want to copy, click the Format Painter button in the toolbar, and then select the text boxes you want to apply the formatting to.
- You can also use the Arrange menu to align and distribute the text boxes in your figure, ensuring that they are evenly spaced and aligned with each other.
- If you have a lot of text boxes in your figure, you may want to use the Group tool to group them together. This will allow you to move and resize the entire group of text boxes as a single unit, making it easier to align and arrange them.
